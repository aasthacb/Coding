Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.

Game Rules
Both players are given the same string, .
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string 

For Example:
String  = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.

Your task is to determine the winner of the game and their score.
